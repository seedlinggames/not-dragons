\[[Table of Contents](../table_of_contents.md)\] \[[Character Creation](../core_character_creation.md)\]

- Gains +2 Physicality, +1 Awareness OR +1 Charisma
- Four Rogue Traits (which have associated skills)

## Rogue Traits:

**Expert Burglar:** You gain the skill Infiltrate. When you spend a point to roll an extra die in Infiltrate, explain how you have invented a technique or a tool to do something that most people cannot do, such as climb and descend steep and sheer walls, cut holes in glass silently, smuggle yourself in in a package without suffocating.

**Supernatural Camouflage** You gain the skill Infiltrate. When you spend a point to roll an extra die in Infiltrate, you can effectively become invisible in the dark, in the mist, or in foliage, as long as you move very carefully. You can walk almost silently, control your breathing, and mask your scent from dogs.

**Better part of Valour** You gain the skill Might. When you need to make your escape, you can spend an Aptitude Point to always escape somehow.

**Mechanical Genius** You gain the skill Manipulate. In addition to the usual uses of Manipulate, pick an area of specialty. Given enough time you can construct an extraordinary item that fits under that specialty, one that might even seem supernatural. Examples include:
- Hidden compartments, weapons, messages.
- Securely lock a room or box so only you can open it.
- Spin thread as strong as steel.
- Items of such extraordinary art and luxury to fascinate even the most worldly - think cloth as light as a spider's web, a clockwork bird that sings like a real bird, a tiny castle carved into the inside of a jewel.

**Poisoner** You gain the skill Endure. Given at least a few hours, you can make a poison. It has one of the following traits:
- No taste or smell
- Very slow acting
- Can be applied to an object or delivered in an unexpected way

It can do one of the following:
- Make the target sleep deeply
- Incapacitate, such as by making temporarily sick
- Kill

**Legendary Thief** You gain The Supernatural as a skill. You pick up a spell from another class. You have stolen a magic or holy artifact you really shouldn't, or perhaps stolen the spell directly. You can use it with Physicality (Manipulate).

**Superhuman Senses** You gain Awareness of Surroundings as a skill. Pick a sense - sight, hearing, smell, etc. You can see with the eyesight of an eagle, hear with the ears of a rabbit, or smell with the nose of a dog. When you spend an Aptitude point to improve your roll, you can use this skill to percieve things that should not be possible.

**Silver tongue** You gain Deceive as a skill. When you spend a die to improve a roll you also improve the Situation of the roll. In general, you can get away with more brazen or implausible lies than is generally possible.

**Uncanny intuition** You gain Awareness of People as a skill. When you spend a die to improve an Awareness of People roll you can infer things about the person that would be highly implausible for you to know.

**Charming Rascal** You gain Persuasion as a skill. When you persuade someone to do something audacious or bold, or to forgive a minor transgression, you improve the situation of that roll.
