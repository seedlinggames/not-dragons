# Core character creation rules

These steps are intended for player characters.

Follow these steps:
1. Describe the basics of your character.
2. Pick backgrounds
3. Pick an archetype

It is probably a good idea to read all the options, then pick.

## Character basics

\[[Table of Contents](table_of_contents.md)\]


Pick a name, pronoun, and general character concept for the character.

Describe their appearance. If you want to have characters that do not strictly appear human, here are some popular concepts from the genre of modern fantasy adventure stories:
- Graceful, with pointed ears, and perhaps some tie to magic, the forest, or both
- Unusually large, with tusks, horns, or other distinctive features
- Particularly small and nimble
- Particularly small, with subtle ties to magic
- Features associated with devilish creatures, such as goat's horns or hooves
- Animal-like attributes, including those of birds, lizards, wolves, etc.
- The attributes of fantastic creatures such as dragons
- Of artificial construction, come to life
- Maybe even a literal animal that can talk
- You look pretty much like a standard human, actually, and that's unique in and of itself

When you discuss the game or campaign you want to play before playing it, it is a good idea to agree what range of appearances you want to have. Some games might only have humans, others might want to stick to a narrower set of fantasy people. Most games will probably have some limits as to what would fit in the game.

Write down some notes about their personalities, goals, etc. There are no specific mechanics for these, but they are still very important, and bringing these into play is a large part of the fun of the game.

# Archetypes

Many game systems call them "classes". The word "class", however, could mean basically anything.

Currently the following archetypes have been defined. Assume all terms are gender-neutral even if they have gendered connotations. You can replace them with similar words if you prefer.

- [Warrior:](archetypes/warrior.md) One of the most common heroes in myth and legend, this is someone who is good at fighting and feats of strength, but has many abilities that make them exceptional.
- [Rogue:](archetypes/rogue.md) The other most common hero in myth and legend, this is someone who uses cleverness and trickery to outwit the more powerful.
- [Priest:](archetypes/priest.md) Serves the gods, solves useful and practical problems like healing people and getting rid of evil spirits.
- [Witch:](archetypes/witch.md) Knows the magic of the forests and fields and the common people. Can also solve people's problems, but is known to also create them.
- [Wizard:](archetypes/wizard.md) Studies long-forgotten, esoteric powers, which are likely long-forgotten for a good reason. Mostly causes problems for the average person, but seems to end up in a lot of adventures.

## Designing Archetypes

Generally, these archetypes give you the following:
- 2 points in one Aptitude and one point in another
- A total of 4 Skills
  - For spellcasters, they have one or two fixed skills and pick the rest from a list.
  - For others, each Trait has a skill associated with them.
- 4 spells OR 4 traits

> I will almost certainly adjust all these numbers, as they will determine the flow and power level of the game and so far I have done no testing at all.

Traits have a skill associated with them. They should also have an ability associated with that skill that allows them to perform extraordinary feats. These should range from being rare skills to almost supernatural abilities like those of heroes of folklore, myth and legend. More powerful abilities should require the expenditure of the associated Aptitude point.

Spells have an Aptitude associated with them and always require that an Aptitude Point be expended with them. If a roll is involved in the spell, the roll is enhanced as though you spent the Aptitude Point to enhance it. Spells should be clearly supernatural.

# Backgrounds

Eventually, this section will be fleshed out with examples. However, I would still encourage people to try designing their own backgrounds to best reflect their characters.

## Designing your own background.

Backgrounds give you:
- 2 Skills
- 2 specialties
- 2 aptitude points
> See the above note about the made-up-ness of these numbers

I recommend breaking up your background into 2 or 3 key elements that describe your character. Where did they grow up? What did they do before adventuring? Were there any defining moment in their lives? Do they have any surprising interests?
