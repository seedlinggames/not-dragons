# Priest
\[[Table of Contents](../table_of_contents.md)\] \[[Character Creation](../core_character_creation.md)\]

- +2 Awareness, +1 Charisma
- Gain Knowledge of the Supernatural and three of the following: Awareness of People, Awareness of Details, Persuade, Command, Manipulate, Endure, Knowledge of Society, Knowledge of the Material.
- Gain the spell Bless and 4 more. Except for Bless, all spells require that you expend an associated Aptitude Point to activate them.

**Bless:**  Make crops grow, children grow strong and healthy, marriages long and happy, that sort of thing. These are long-term effects. The real mechanical effect is to make people see you more favourably and be happy that you have arrived.

## Awareness spells:
**Detect Lies:** For 5 minutes, you can tell if anyone speaking in your presence is lying. You can't tell if they are saying something false that they believe to be true. They can evade this by saying things that are technically true.

**Speak with spirits:**  You can speak with the spirits of the dead, or spirits that are just generally around places of supernatural power. They may have their own agendas.

**Discern the holy and profane:** You can detect the presence of supernatural beings, including the undead and fey spirits, and of objects and locations that are holy or desecrated.

**Read omen** You spend a few minutes performing a ritual to commune with the gods. This gives some indication of the future, but the gods are inscrutable and prophecy often leads you astray. Omens can generally be described in about one word.
- I recommend thinking of this as a way to get some fun foreshadowing and not to necessarily get the world's most useful information.

## Charisma Spells:

**Cleanse:** Make a roll, enhanced by the die you spent, to consecrate a room, exorcise a spirit, or drive off or ward against the undead. If the ground is consecrated or you have access to a consecrated object, the situation is Favourable.
- This only can destroy a spirit on a roll of a 7 or 8.

> A Consecrated place makes rolling against evil spirits and other supernatural beings a Favourable situation for all rolls.
> Additionally, killing a mortal on consecrated ground curses you until the associated god can be mollified, except as a sacrifice endorsed by the associated god.
> Curses are all different, but should have the sort of major effect on the story that you would expect from incurring the wrath of a god.

**Desecrate:** Make a roll, enhanced by the die you spent, to desecrate an area or object, perform an evil ritual, summon a demon, or strengthen an evil being.
- Obviously, this is generally frowned upon.

> When the ground is Desecrated, you are in a Difficult situation when rolling against  evil spirits and other such supernatural beings. When you kill a mortal on desecrated ground, you may choose to permanently increase all Aptitude points by two and gain any Trait or Spell of your choice, but you will permanently register as an evil spirit in Priest spells.

**Calm:** [possible content warning: mental health] Remove an effect that causes fear or other such mental effects, or temporarily quell those that are ongoing, whether or not they are supernatural in origin.  For instance, if someone is afraid of heights but you need to help them descend a cliff, this can be used to make the situation easier. The target may reject this effect.

**Heal:** Relieve pain and hasten healing. This can, for instance, in combination with a splint and some assistance, allow someone to continue traveling after breaking their leg, but does not knit the bone together. It can slow the flow of blood and prevent infection, but doesn't allow an immediate recovery. The target may reject this effect.

**Take Oath:** Assist in a ritual where you or someone else willingly takes an oath to engage in a specific course of action before the gods. Breaking the oath will cause you to be cursed by the gods, and require some inconvenience to placate them. Oaths are not something to take lightly.
