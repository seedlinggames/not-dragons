# Core rules
\[[Table of Contents](table_of_contents.md)\]

When a situation could result in either success or failure, and it's interesting and suspenseful to determine the outcome, this is called a *Challenge*. The player taking the action rolls dice to determine the outcome.

- The player determines how many dice to roll based on *Attributes* that represent the player character's capabilities to perform the task.
- The GM determines the *Difficulty* of the situation to determine what size of dice (d4, d6, or d8) the player rolls.
- This will result in a number between 1 and 8, with lower numbers being worse outcomes and higher numbers being extraordinarily good outcomes.

# Attributes

Player characters have 3 major types of attributes on their character sheet:
- Aptitude Points
- Skills
- Specialties

They may additionally have optional abilities they can make use of, but these generally change what is narratively possible. These are elaborated on the section on [Creating Player Characters](TODO).

## Aptitudes
All Challenges are generally governed by an Aptitude. These cover very broad categories of actions you might take.

- **Knowledge** covers all forms of knowledge, whether gained through formal or informal education, other training, or secrets passed down through the ages.
- **Awareness** governs your ability to understand through careful or patient listening, watching and observing.
- **Charisma** governs your ability to influence others.
- **Physicality** governs all actions that depend on your body: its strength, precision, toughness, etc.

**Aptitude Points:**   
 Player characters have *Aptitude Points* in various numbers in each of the four Aptitudes. These points can be spent to greatly improve the chance of success for a single die roll, as described below. It may be possible to spend them for other purposes. The points can be regained by spending some amount of time, at least an hour or so, doing something the player character finds relaxing.

## Skills

Each Aptitude has several skills associated with it. A player either has a skill, or they do not. These skills are deliberately broad with varied possible interpretations.

**Knowledge of:**
- **Nature:** Knowledge of natural phenomena
  - E.g. Of plants, animals, weather, water, medicine, and strange natural phenomena.
- **Society:** History, politics, etiquette, well known factions, etc
- **The Supernatural:** Gods, magic, and strange creatures, and related phenomena.
- **The Material:** Machines, buildings, tunnels, tools, cloth, food, and similar.

**Awareness of:**
- **Details:** Notice small things that are hidden with careful examination
  -  Examples: a brick that opens a secret door, a line in a book that has been erased and rewritten.
- **Surroundings:** Notice the bigger things.
   - Examples: See a great distance, hear someone sneaking around, notice the food tastes off.
- **People:** Understand what people say with body language, or indirectly, including if they are lying.
   - Examples: gauge their attitude towards you, realize they are avoiding a subject.
- **Animals:** Understand the behaviour of animals, and interact with animals effectively.

**Charisma:**
- **Socialize:** Interact with other people effectively over a period of time.
  - Examples: Making a good first impression, gathering rumours, fitting in at an event you shouldn't be at.
- **Persuade:** Directly convince someone to engage in or support a course of action, now or in the future.
- **Deceive:** Through lies or lies of omission, convince someone of something which is not true.
  - This should generally be high risk, high reward - people do not like being lied to.
- **Command:** Throw your authority around, e.g. legal, religious, force of personality.
  - Also high risk, high reward, doubly so if it involves threats, physical or otherwise.

**Physicality:**
- **Infiltrate:** Skills involved in sneaking, traveling and entering in unconventional ways.
  - Examples: climb, balance, hide, sneak, camoflage.
  - Applies in the city, in nature, and everywhere in between.
- **Manipulate:** Anything that requires fine and delicate work.
  - Examples: traps and locks; delicate machines; sewing; clockwork; sleight of hand; patching up a wound.
- **Might:** Swim, run, jump, lift heavy things, break things.
- **Endure:** Shrug off poison, disease, extreme heat or cold, hunger, thirst, and the effects of substances.

## Specialities
Player characters may also have specialties under each skill, where they can apply the skill under very specific circumstances. For instance, they may be able to use *Awareness of animals* on horses, or *Knowledge of society* only on things that happened over 200 years ago.

# Rolling To Resolve a Challenge

When there is a question as to whether you might succeed or fail, or at least when it is interesting to have a chance of success or failure, you roll dice to determine the outcome. Note that when a roll is made, there should be a plan for how the story proceeds on a failure.

### Results
The possible results of a roll can be ranked from 1 to 8.  1 is the worst possible result, and 8 is the best possible result. In most cases, this is the distribution you would use:
- 1: A failure, with a further consequence.
- 2: A failure with no consequence beyond the failure.
- 3-4: A partial success.
- 5-6: A success.
- 7-8: A success with a long-term benefit beyond the success.

To get that result, you roll one or two dice. The type of dice you roll depends on the situation.

### Difficulty

In a **Difficult situation**, you roll d4s. At best, you can get a partial success.  
In an **Average situation**, you roll d6s. At best, you can get a success.  
In a **Favourable situation**, you roll d8s. There's a chance things might go exceptionally well.

### Using Attributes
The attributes you have determine how many dice you roll.

- By default, you roll two dice and take the lower value.
- If you can *improve the roll* one step, you roll one die.
- If you can *improve the roll* two steps, you roll two dice and take the higher value.

You cannot improve the roll more than two steps, unless some special rule comes into play, but if you could, you would roll an increasing number of dice, taking the higher value.

You can improve the roll as follows:
- If you have the relevant Skill, you improve the roll by one step automatically. You can do this as many times as the Skill is applicable.
- If you don't have the relevant Skill, but a Specialty applies, you can also improve the roll by one step.
- You may spend an associated Aptitude Point to improve the roll by one step. You may only spend one die.

# Fighting
The rules for fighting are minimal. More rules might be added in the future, but for now, it is assumed that it will not be the focus of any game using this system. But it is also assumed that, due to the genre, the player characters are very good at fighting.

**Combat mechanic:**
- The player character(s) win.
- Decide as a group what it cost you.
- If the odds are overwhelming, "winning" might look more like "escape" or "survival" and it might be appropriate to bring other mechanics into play.

## Some advice on situations and specialties

Ultimately, how these rules are applied should depend primarily on the preference of the players and GM, and they probably can be applied to create many styles of game. However, here is how I see them being used.

First of all, never ask for a roll unless the story can continue if the players fail.

The players are in a *Bad situation* if they are at a disadvantage. In a new situation, players might start out here. For instance, they might be at a disadvantage with social skills in a new town when they show up as potentially dangerous strangers.  

A *Bad Situation* applies on a per action basis. If the townspeople distrust them, that doesn't make it harder for them to save someone from being trampled by a runaway cart. And players should be able to quickly turn the situation into an *Average situation*, for instance by saving someone from a runaway cart. They don't even always have to roll to improve the situation. A letter of recommendation from the temple in town, for instance, might give their mission some validity.

Since the best you can get in a *Bad Situation* is a partial success, that might mean they don't accomplish their goal but they do improve the situation. For instance, the villagers think their plan to reach the Cursed Tower is foolhardy and want no part in it, but they no longer think the player characters are potential threats, and may be willing to drink with them before they head to their doom.

A *Favourable Situation* generally requires clever action on the part of players or prior successes to achieve. After shocking everyone by not just returning alive from the Cursed Tower, but also returning the Lost Reliquary to the village shrine, they might agree to not just support but actively take part in your next foolish plan. It's still more likely they don't. But it's possible.

*Specialties* should not come up too often, so that they feel significant when they do, but the GM should make sure they do come up enough to feel like they matter. The intended effect is to allow a character to shine, perhaps unexpectedly, in a particular scene, and add a bit more complexity to a character. For instance, a normally shy performer might find a surprising confidence on a stage or in front of an audience.

## Some advice on resolving fights



Some general guidelines:
- For the average fight, "winning" might mean the enemy is killed, flees, or surrenders, as appropriate. In most situations, the enemy tries not to die.
- If the consequences fall on one or more player characters, the players involved should be the ones to suggest it.
- For small fights, the consequences might be small.
  - Example: you kill a guard while infiltrating a prison. This puts a wrinkle in your plan because you have to deal with the body or deal with alert guards.
- For your average fight:
  - Maybe they flee and are now determined to cause problems later
  - Maybe they are killed and a relative vows revenge
  - Mybe the law is unforgiving to violence even in self-defence.
- For fights with overwhelming odds, the cost should be immense and you should gain little. This situation should happen rarely and be a climactic moment in the story.
  - Perhaps you are forced to flee, and the enemy wins (for today).
  - Or perhaps someone sacrifices themselves to allow the rest to escape.
- For fights you didn't start, and tried your best to avoid, the consequences might be minimal or non-existent. But sometimes unfair consequences  make a better story.

> The intention here is to have a story that contains violence, but infrequently. The stories that fantasy adventure games are based on usually feature violence, but only occasionally and at critical points in the story. A common approach to decreasing the amount of violence is to make it more deadly. What if instead it became a less interesting option?
>
 > This also incidentally solves some problems with typical fantasy adventuring systems. For instance, a problem I always had with rogues and other characters that might scout ahead is that there is often an assumption the party is never split, which limits what they can do if the entire party isn't stealthy.
