  - Although this is a low-combat system, there are references to violence, the undead, physical danger, and injury throughout the ruleset, and the rules are targeted towards a genre where such things are likely to at least occur in the background.
  - I have noted rules that refer to substances, mind control, and more specific phobias where they occur. These portions of the rules can be easily omitted.
