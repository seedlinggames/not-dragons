# Character creation (simple variant)
\[[Table of Contents](table_of_contents.md)\]


**Minimum steps**
1. Every player describes their character: what they look like, their personalities, their name and pronouns, etc.
2. Every player assigns 5 points to any of the four Aptitudes (Knowledge, Awareness, Charisma, Physicality)
3. Every player picks 5 skills that they have.

**Optional steps**
4. Optionally, every player picks 3 specialties.
5. Optionally, every player picks 4 abilities from any of the Archetypes in [Core Character Creation rules](TODO)

These numbers are arbitrary; you can adjust them up or down depending on how powerful you want the party to be. However, all players should have the same number for each type of attribute.

> TODO: some actual guidance on those numbers based on playtesting.

## Leveling up

At key moments in the game, everyone gains an Aptitude Point, or a skill, usually after finishing some significant task.
