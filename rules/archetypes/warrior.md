\[[Table of Contents](../table_of_contents.md)\] \[[Character Creation](../core_character_creation.md)\]

- +2 Physicality, +1 Charisma
- Four of the Warrior traits (which have associated skills)

# Main Traits:
*It's recommended you take at least one of these for the archetype to make sense.*

**Superhuman Strength:** You gain Might as a skill. When you spend a Physicality point to roll an extra die for Might, you can perform a superhuman feat of strength. Consider mythical heroes with superhuman strength for inspiration.

**Legendary Sword:** You gain Might as a skill. You pick up a spell from another class. You can use it with Physicality (Might) and channel it through your sword.

**Iron Stomach:** You gain Endure as a skill. You are immune to the mechanical effects of intoxicants and all effects of poisons.

**Divine Blessing:** you gain Endure as a skill. For supernatural reasons, you can only die under very specific circumstances. While it is true for all player characters that they will only die when the player decides it's an appropriate point in the story, this also allows the character to survive unlikely events and will affect how others see you. Unlike Iron Stomach, this does not prevent you from being temporarily incapacitated by poison.

## Secondary Traits:
*Some of these, like Authority and Folk Hero, do not fit together well.*

**Authority:** You gain the Command skill. When you use a Charisma point on Command, you call upon the authority of an aristocratic, military or religious title to allow you to use Command more effectively than should be possible. Additionally, when it makes sense in the story, you don't need to roll to exert your authority.

**Folk Hero:** You gain the Socialize skill. When you use Socialize with ordinary people without special titles etc, you can use this trait to automatically improve the Situation.

**Dark Past** You gain the Deceive skill. You gain a Specialty in Socialize, Persuade and Command when dealing with those who exist outside the law.

**Warrior-Poet** You gain the Knowledge of Society skill. You are generally considered to be a respectable member of society, and when interacting with those who aspire to be "cultured", you can use this trait to automatically improve the Situation.

**Knight** You gain the Awareness (Animals) skill.  When interacting with mounts, dogs and tame birds of prey that are accustomed to working with you and that you treat well, they will act on your behalf with courage and precision. This is not meant to represent a European knight specifically, but also to encompass many similar traditions throughout the world.

**Follower of the Code** You gain Knowledge of the Supernatural. Throughout history, there have supposedly been many codes of honour for noble warriors. Whether or not they ever actually were followed is another question, but you follow them. Write down what principles you follow. People generally respect that you are a person of principle (unless you prove otherwise), and you have a specialty in using Persuade or Command to hold people to the values they nominally hold.
