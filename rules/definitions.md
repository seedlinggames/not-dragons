**Evil:** When talking about mortals, "evil" is a subjective concept like in real life, and usually describes actions, not individuals.

In mechanical terms, it refers to spirits that are hostile to mortals and gods, and the powers associated with them, especially in the context of Priest spells. This is a practical judgement rather than a moral one.
