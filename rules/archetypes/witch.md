Gains:
- +2 Knowledge, +1 Charisma
- Gain Knowledge of Nature and three of the following: Knowledge of the Supernatural; Awareness of Surroundings, People or Animals; Decieve, Command, Infiltrate, Manipulate
- Gain four spells. As with the Priest, you must expend an Aptitude Point to activate them.

# Knowledge spells:

**Fly:** At night, spend 5 minutes to imbue an object with the power of flight. You can now fly until the sun begins to rise. You fly at high speed, but cannot manouever fast.

 **Wild Growth:** Cause plants to grow supernaturally fast. A sapling becomes a tree overnight. Hedges grow to block a path in minutes. A plant blooms and fruits. Or reverse the spell to blight crops and wither trees.

 **Change Weather:** You induce a change in the weather that is natural to the location. You can bring down fog, bring or calm the winds, bring or drive away rain, bring thunderstorms, and in the winter, make it colder, or make it snow. You can only make changes that could plausibly be natural.

 **Control water:** [Possible content warning: drowning] You can, for instance:
 - Bring forth a large amount of water from a small source, including a vessel.
 - Slowly flood a building or cavern, taking at least a day.
 - Drain water, clearing a path through a marsh or very shallow lake.
 - Hold back water in a river and then let it gush forth.
 - Summon a large wave at sea.

**Commune with nature:** You can ask questions of plants and animals. They might not understand what they have seen the way you do.
 - Plants have impressions: light and water make big impressions, fast-moving creatures make small ones. They might remember that the ground shaked, or branches were bent and broken, or a fire was lit. Trees remember centuries and have a vague notion of mere days.
 - Animals percieve precisely, but understand things differently. They are likely to care about and notice loud noises, sudden changes, the presence of food, or big crowds, or animals like dogs that their percieve as a threat. Crows remember faces, but many animals remember scents instead. Most animals ar bad at counting. Some animals can detect illnesses; cats can see evil spirits.

**Brew potion:** [Content warning: drug use] You can create a potion, given time and materials. The potion can do one of the following:
 - Cure a health problem of the sort that modern pharmecuticals could cure.
 - Create a common poison. It must be ingested and can be detected by someone with knowledge of these things.
 - Create a potion that allows the recipient to spend Physicality Aptitude Points for Charisma or Awareness skills.
 - Create a potion that can cause someone to have a vision that may or may not be true or useful.

# Charisma spells:
**Heal:** As cleric.

**Calm:** As cleric.

**Inhabit animal**. You can ride in the body of an animal and offer suggestions on what to do. It can kick you out any time. Usually, this is done with animals that trust you and with bribes, either of treats, or of promises to solve their problems with your opposable thumbs and such.
- For an animal you have a good relationship with, assume they will do anything that is not actively dangerous, or that is in their nature.
- While this happens, your normal body lies unconscious.
- If you stay in the animal for more than a few days, you might forget to return.
- Someone observintg the animal closely might notice it is behaving a bit strangely, though. For instance, cats rarely sneak into strangers' houses to read their letters.

# Spells that are heavily frowned upon:
The group should carefully discuss if they want to introduce these spells for player characters, since you would then be moving towards what is often referred to as an "evil campaign".

**Possession:** [Content warning: mind control.] A Charisma spell. Like inhabit animal, but make a Command roll to forcibly take over a body, including humans, or to force someone into the body of an animal for a day.  Can be reversed by the Cleanse spell to expel evil spirits.

**Curse:** A Knowledge spell. Make someone sick, milk sour, crops wither, tools blunt and break, etc. Milder curses than what the gods bring. Can be reversed by the Bless spell.

**Call demon:** A Charisma spell. You summon a demon or another dangerous supernatural creature.
- Roll Command. On a 1-2, it is loose, hostile and dangerous. On a 7-8, wholly safe. In between, it could go wrong any time.
- It will answer one question on a partial success, three otherwise. It knows things no mortal would know and can be extremely helpful.
- It may offer a deal. It can offer pretty much anything. The demon is now free to pursue its agenda in the mortal world, perhaps in the form of a mortal, until someone stops it.
