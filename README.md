The basic rules for my as-of-yet-not-really-named low-combat fantasy adventure system will go here.

\[[THE RULES](rules/table_of_contents.md)\]

There is a game that previously existed only in my imagination. It's the game that you want the game to be between fights in fantasy adventure RPGs. It isn't really relationship-oriented, and it's still about people who are particularly good at killing and perhaps are not quite connected to the communities where they live. It isn't trying to fill the niche that PbtA or BoB or even FitD fills. Although FitD comes closest. 

I want to keep it fairly simple, something that could be defined at its core in a page or two. 

It is also definitely quite opinionated, once you get outside the core rules.

## Version
The current version is: **v0.1.0**

I am using semver: https://semver.org/
The "API" for this project is anything in the "rules" directory.

## TODO
- come up with a better name
- write description
- write what I plan to do with this
- add a license

## Current Contributors
- Seedling games (https://twitter.com/SeedlingGames)

## Compatible products
None yet, since I haven't written the rules down

## License
There will be one, soon. It will probalby be creative commons with attribution, but there might be some specific things I want to restrict more.

## Why Github?
- I'm familiar with it
- It's easy to keep track of changes and have different versions, with previous versions accessible and labeled.
- It's easy* for potentially other people to contribute in the future, while still allowing me to have some editorial control over what gets added
- It's easy* for other people to copy and modify their own versions, once I set up a license
- It's easy* to download, to keep copies of, and to move the copies to other platforms should it become necessary
- It formats markdown nicely, and can host any other files
- If I ever want to make electronic tools, it's great for hosting that
- Maybe it can integrate nicely with my website? No idea, should look into that

* as long as you learn how to use github

The main downside is that it isn't a platform for selling things. However, the way I plan to use this is that the base rules will be hosted here, and then I'll make paid supplements, and maybe you'll be able to buy a nicely formatted and laid out version with art and additional writing once I reach v0.1.0.  

For the paid supplements, I have this vague plan to make "APIs" where like I can say this one introduces this class with these abilities but doesn't define them, so that it is easy to refer to them without the whole thing you get with *certain* game systems where you can't even mention names of things, but I'm not yet sure if that would even make sense.
