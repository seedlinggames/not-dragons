## Acceptable spells

**Manipulate from afar:** You reach out your hand, and can move objects you can clearly see as though you could touch them. You can pull levers, open doors, and move anything around you could move with your hand. It is kind of obvious you are doing it.

**Invisibility:** Roll Knowledge of the Supernatural for it.  You might become visible suddenly at an inconvenient time.

**Float:** Make a person or object no larger than a person fly slowly in a particular direction. Can be downwards, sideways, or upwards. It is very hard to move anyone any direction than down; it costs an extra point for every 10 feet.

**Speak from afar:** You can speak to someone whose name you know through a mirror. You appear as a hazy apparition in the air.

**Change face** Replace your face with someone else's. You must be looking at them. As with Invisibility, roll  Knowledge of the Supernatural to see if it suddenly wears off.

**Locate** You suspend a needle from a string and it points towards the object, as a magnet does. It can be as far as you want, which can be good or bad. The needle gets confused if the object moves. It can find a specific object you are familiar with or can visualize, but tends to be vague with more general objects such as "gold". Finding water works pretty well because there aren't many other liquids it could get confused with.

**Quick Fix** You make an object temporarily better: if it's broken, you fix it; if it's old, it's new, etc. Roll Knowledge of the Supernatural to see how well it goes. On a success it lasts at least a few hours. On a 7-8, you can disguise it entirely as something else, e.g. a shiny rock becomes a gold coin. Depending on how you use it, there could be negative consequences.

**Scry** You must have designated an object in advance. It must be something you can see your reflection in, e.g. a mirror, a pool of water, or a polished orb. Alternately, it can be a depiction of eyes (a statue, a painting, etc.) You can see and hear through the object for up to an hour. Doing so impedes your ability to see and hear locally.

**Pyrotechnics** For up to one hour, you hold a small flame in your hands that doesn't burn you. You can use it to:
- Make it glow brightly enough to light the way, or dim it to an ember, but if you hide it entirely, you will quench the flame.
- Light or extinguish fires at a distance. You can only light things that are especially susceptible to burning, such as an unlit torch or a pile of paper. It won't light a house on fire unless it is made of straw or something.
- Light a campfire or similar in the wind or rain and it will stay lit.
- Put on an impressive fireworks display.

## Spells that are heavily frowned upon:

**Call demon:** As the witch spell, but use Knowledge.

**Bind undead:** Similar to calling a demon, except you call a spirit of the dead and instead you bind it to a vessel, usually a corpse, skeleton, etc. The undead creature hungers for something and will *probably* obey you as long as you supply it.

**Compel:** [Content Warning: Mind Control] Everything just goes your way. People are much more likely to agree with you, believe you, go along with what you say. They might do things that are not reasonable to do, but won't do anything that directly harms themselves or those they care about. When it wears off, you probably don't want to stick around. This is why people are suspicious of wizards.
