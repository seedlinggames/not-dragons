# Some basic concepts and terminology

*If you have played any RPG before you can probably skip this section.*

This game is played with two or more people. Four to seven are probably ideal.
- One person is designated the *Game Master* (usually called the GM). They are responsible for creating situations and minor characters for the players to interact with to create a story that is fun and engaging for everyone at the table (including the GM).
- The other people are the *players*. They typically each play one *player character*. These characters are essentially the protagonists of the story. They are responsible for directing the actions of that character to create a story that is fun and engaging for everyone at the table (including themselves).

Other variations on this are possible.
- One person can play more than one character. It's just more to keep track of and requires mentally switching between characters.
- With additional rules, it could be possible to make a game where all players share the GM's responsibility equally, or where one person can play alone. I haven't investigated what these rules might look like, let alone written them, though.

This game is played dice of different shapes. These are designated by a "d" followed by the number of sides, e.g. d4s have 4 sides, d6s have 6 sides, d8s have 8 sides. You can designate that you roll more than one by putting that number before the d, e.g. 2d6 means to roll 2 six sided dice.

The general flow of the game is that the GM describes the scene or situation, and the players describe how they interact with the situation. When the players attempt something where the question of whether they succeed or fail is interesting, they use the rules of this game to roll dice to determine the outcome. The player characters differ from each other both in subjective descriptions (appearance, personality, etc) and in numeric attributes that represents their strengths and weaknesses with regards to these dice rolls.

It is a good idea to discuss what sort of game you want to play in advance: what themes interest you and don't interest you, if there are any topics you want to avoid, what the world you will be playing in roughly looks like, what characters everyone plays and how they know each other. Some people do this in a scheduled session, often called "Session Zero", but others find it convenient to have these conversations over text. It is also a good idea to continue communicating out of character as the game goes on.

There is no incorrect way to play, so long as everyone is having fun. It is very common to modify rules according to the preferences of those at the table (referred to as "house rules").
